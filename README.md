### Description

A simple website made with Next.js and TailwindCSS. I was building this to learn and experiment with both technology. Next.js is great for static website, and with Next.js we can selectively decide between client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR) for different parts of the application. Next.js provides a flexible approach to control rendering behavior based on our needs.
